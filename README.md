- This prediction model forecasts the distance of a batted baseball. The primary aspiration is to contribute meaningful insights to the baseball community.

## **[Drag Coefficient](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Physics)**

- Inspired by ["Simplified Models for the Drag Coefficient of a Pitched Baseball" by David Kagan & Alan M. Nathan](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/DragTPTMay2014.pdf), this project observes how tempurature, humidity, and air pressure affect the drag coef.

## **[Park Factors](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Stadiums)**
