## **[Distance Predictor](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Distance-Predictor)**

- This prediction model forecasts the distance of a batted baseball. The primary aspiration is to contribute meaningful insights to the baseball community.

## **[Drag Coefficient](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Physics)**

- Inspired by ["Simplified Models for the Drag Coefficient of a Pitched Baseball" by David Kagan & Alan M. Nathan](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/DragTPTMay2014.pdf), this project observes how tempurature, humidity, and air pressure affect the drag coef.

## **[Park Factors](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Stadiums)**

- Inspired by [Pitcher List Park Factor Articles](https://www.pitcherlist.com/going-deep-barrels-and-ballpark-factors/), this project observes the HRs trends within each stadium.


## **TODO**

- [Spray Display](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Spray%20Display), In this project, I display a live spray chart reactive to pitch location, launch angle, and launch speed for the 2022 MLB Season for righties

- [Sharpe Ratios](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/Sharpe-Ratios)

- [WAR](https://github.com/dec1costello/Baseball/tree/main/WAR)
