## **Made some Baseball Projects....**

In Parts 1 & 2, I explore the data and start to feature engineer to help understand, clean, and refine the dataset. It guides model choice and assumption validation, while also revealing insights through visualization. By addressing data quality and understanding patterns early, here I establish a strong foundation for the rest of my project.
