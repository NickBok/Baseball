## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Distance Predictor**. Inspired by [NASA's Distance Predictor](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/whit/#play-ball), this project harnesses data from  [Pybaseball Data](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball), specifically from the 2022 MLB Season, to forecast the trajectory of batted ball distances. With an interest in hitting mechanics and atmospheric influences, the primary aspiration is to contribute meaningful insights to the baseball community. To get a better feel for the visual details, I encourage you to check out the interactive visuals created using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.org/) for [Parts 3-5 on NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/dec1costello/Baseball/blob/main/Distance-Predictor/). Also, as [Tyler James Burch](https://github.com/tjburch) pointed out, because [Triples are hard to distinguish](http://tylerjamesburch.com/blog/baseball/hit-classifier-1), I combined Triples and Home Runs in my Event visuals.

## **Task List (TODO)**

- Integrate Humidor Stadium data, humidity, and [temperature](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/HRProbTemp.pdf) during games
