## **Part 3, [Model Selection](https://nbviewer.org/github/dec1costello/Baseball/blob/main/Distance-Predictor/Distance-Predictor-Part-3.ipynb)**

In Part 3, I use grid search to select the best ML model, as it entails choosing the most suitable algorithm for a given task. It ensures optimal use of resources by aligning the algorithm's assumptions with the data characteristics. This leads to better predictive accuracy, efficient training, and successful problem-solving. I trained each model with the same data as well.

# Part 3 TODO - Rerun LazyPredict
- Scale as well as one hot encode beforehand
