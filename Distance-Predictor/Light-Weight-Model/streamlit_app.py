The values of hyperparameters such as maximum tree depth and  number of features considered at each node were arrived at via grid search optimization.''')

For each player, I  used his stats in the final year of his old contract as the feature (input) variables and his new salary the following year as the target (output) variable. I also normalized each salary by that year's salary cap , since teams evaluate salaries as a percentage of the salary cap, rather than by the specific dollar amount. ''')

The machine learning model deployed in this app is an XGBoost Regressor that uses Exit Velocity, Launch Angle, and Pull% to predict the distance of a batted ball all scraped from [Pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball), specifically from the 2022 MLB Season.

[Pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) scraped [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/), [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/), and [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/) so I didn't have to üòÉ!''')
